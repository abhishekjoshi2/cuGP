<a id="Checkpoint Update" class="anchor" href="#checkpoint" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Checkpoint Update</h3>


<ul>

<li> <b>Implementing Gaussian Process Regression in C++:</b></li>
<p> As planned, we have successfully implemented Gaussian Process Regression in C++. This proved to be harder than what we had expected, since many of the implementation intricacies cropped up as we started coding each step. We have tested our code against an implementation of Gaussian Process Regression in Matlab (GPML toolbox by Rasmussen and Nickisch), and we have achieved full accuracy in all stages of the computation.</p>

<li> <b>Implementing 2 Covariance Kernels:</b></li>
<p> We have implemented 2 covariance kernels: Squared Exponential Kernel along with the Noise Kernel. For now, we have pushed the task of implementing the third covariance kernel to a lower priority task, since we don't think it is crucial to our task of "parallelizing Gaussian Process", and would be more suited to a primarily ML-focused project. Moreover, implementing SE Kernel + Noise Kernel is sufficient for implementing the whole training and regression task.
</p>

<li> <b>Naively parallelizing Gaussian Process in CUDA:</b></li>
<p> As planned, we have also successfully ported a naive version of Gaussian Process regression code in CUDA. This involved breaking down many of the steps of the computation into modular and reusable parts of code that are amenable to be run on CUDA. We will now briefly describe the different kernels that we have implemented as a part of the whole stack. For all kernels, X is the input training matrix, N is the number of training samples, and DIM is the number of parameters for each training sample:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b> compute_K_train: </b></li>

<p> We launch N*N threads - one for each element in the N*N covariance matrix. Each thread picks up its required input working set from the X matrix and fills up the (i,j)th entry in the K matrix, which is the covariance matrix. This can be further improved by collaborative loading of X into shared memory.</p>

<li> <b> compute_cholesky: </b></li>
<p> We use Cholesky factorization to factorize the K matrix into a lower triangular matrix L (and its corresponding upper triangular matrix U). Cholesky factorization is further broken down into a series of kernels such as taking offsetted transpose, rectangular forward substitution, generic matrix transpose, matrix multiplication, and offsetted matrix subtraction. We implemented parallel Cholesky by referring to the algorithm given in [DA14]. Currently, for taking the pure Cholesky in the first step of the recursive process, we have fixed our <i>b</i> parameter to be 2. Going forward, we hope to try doing the same for <i>b = 3</i> and <i>b = 4</i>.</p>

<li> <b> matrix_transpose: </b></li>
<p> Matrix transpose is needed at several points during training, and therefore we have written a naive implementation of matrix transpose in CUDA, where the (i, j)th thread fills up the (j, i)th entry in the transpose matrix. We are not sure if there are better ways to do this, and we will be on the look out for a better implementation. </p>

<li> <b> matrix_multiplication: </b></li>
<p> Matrix multiplication is another important piece of our implementation, and currently we have a naively parallel version of matrix multiplication where we launch one thread for every element of the output matrix. Going forward, we plan to implemented the same using shared memory and collaboratively loading data sets into shared memory.</p>

<li> <b> rectangular_forward_substitution: </b></li>
<p> Forward substitution helps us solve equations of the form <i><b>AX = B</b></i> where A, X, B are matrices, A and B are known, and X is unknown. For now, we launch one thread for each column of X, since each column is independent of each other.</p>

<li> <b> determinant_lower_triangular_matrix: </b></li>
<p> We need the determinant of the lower triangular matrix U. We thought we might have to implement a parallel version for finding the determinant, but later realized that the determinant can be naively taken by taking the square of the product of the diagonal elements! We launch one thread for taking the determinant, which sequentially walks the whole diagonal and calculates the product of all the elements.</p>

<li> <b> vector_forward_substution and vector_backward_substitution: </b></li>
<p> This is the most sequential part of the whole system, and is currently a major bottleneck. For now, we have an extremely naively parallel version in CUDA, which doesn't perform well. We had expected this, and will now implement a different algorithm for implementing these two kernels, which is more amenable to parallelizing on CUDA.</p>

<li> <b> compute_squared_distance, elementwise_matrix_mult, subtract_matrices, get_outer_product: </b></li>
<p> All these kernels have been naively parallelized by launching one thread for each element, since each of them can be done without any dependencies. </p>

</ul>

<li> <b> Schedule and Progress </b></li>
Please find our progress below (at the end of the page). We would say that we are in sync with our proposed schedule :D.

<h3><a id="finaldemo" class="anchor" href="#finaldemo" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Demo</h3>
For the final demo, we will show graphs of our system's performance and show speedups as against the serial version.

  <h3>
<a id="Prelim-results" class="anchor" href="#presults" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preliminary Results</h3>

<p>
The figure below shows the time it takes to obtain the Cholesky decomposition for 2 different dataset sizes (N = 500 and N = 1000 samples) for the serial GP implementation vs the naive GPU implemnentation. We see that the speedup for N = 1000 is around 10x.

The figure below shows the time taken for computing the log marginal likelihood for the 2 implementations. The worse performance of our naive GPU implementation is as expected. This is because our forward subsitution and backward substition modules are run by a single CUDA thread (due to the inherent sequential nature of the algorithm itself). This time includes the time taken by the Cholesky and the forward-backward substitution routines.

  <h3>
<a id="Current-Challenges" class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Challenges</h3>

We have identified 2 key challenges that have to be addressed for an efficient final CUDA implementation:
<ul>
<li> <b> Cholesky decomposition </b> </li>
<p> In the computation of the log marginal-likelihood we need to perform Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. As of now we have implemented a blocked-recursive algorithm for computing it. However, we think that a better use of shared memory and a hybrid algorithm would surely be beneficial. </p>

<li> <b> Triangular Matrix Inversion </b> </li> 
<p> Triangular matrix inversion (TMI) basically comprises of the forward-substitution routines for both vectors as well as matrices. Due to the inherently sequential algorithm for solving forward/backward substitution for a vector, currently, our CUDA kernel implemention for it is quite naive. We have gone through some recent papers, and have found a recursive algorithm that seems to be more CUDA friendly. So one of our primary goals is to implement an efficient triangular matrix inversion module.   </p>
  
</ul>

<a id="nicetohaves" class="anchor" href="#nicetohaves" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Nice-to-have</h3>
We are contemplating moving to a distributed enviroment once we optimize our single node performance. We would then be able to extract extremely high performance from multiple GPUs. However, this is definitely a stretch goal for us, and would be undertaken only after we feel confident about our single node performance.

<h3><a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We are going to parallelize the training and prediction phases of Gaussian Process Regression on a GPU.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>Gaussian Process (GP) regression models have become very popular in recent years in the machine learning community. This can be attributed to the flexibility offered by these models to allow users to choose the appropriate covariance function to control the degree of smoothness. GP regression is basically a Bayesian nonparametric model (where an underlying finite-dimensional random variable is replaced by a stochastic process). Formally, a GP is a stochastic process where any finite number of random variables have a joint Gaussian distribution [RW06]. </p>

<p>A GP is completely specified by a mean function ($m(\vec{x})$) and a covariance function ($\kappa (\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$), which for a real process $f(\vec{x})$ can be defined as:</p>

<p>$$ m(\vec{x}) = \mathbf{E}[f(\vec{x})] \ 
\kappa (\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) =  \mathbf{E}[(f(\vec{x}_1) - m(\vec{x}_1))( f(\vec{x}_2) - m(\vec{x}_2)  )] $$</p>

<p>Generally, the mean function is taken as zero. In that case, the covariance function  ($\kappa (\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$) basically turns into the covariance between $f(\vec{x}_1)$ and $f(\vec{x}_2)$. The squared exponential (SE) kernel is a common choice of covariance function (amongst a wide range of available choices for the kernel), and is defined as follows:
$$ \kappa (\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)  = \exp( -\frac{1}{2l^2} | \vec{x}_1 -  \vec{x}_2 |^2 ),$$
where, $l$ is the lengthscale parameter that needs to be estimated.</p>


<p>In order to perform nonparametric regression, a GP prior is placed over the unknown function. The posterior distribution obtained by multiplying the prior with the likelihood is again a GP. The predictive distribution for a new test point ( $ \vec{x}_{t} $ ), given the entire dataset ($n$ tuples of the form $(\vec{x}, y)$) can be shown to be a Gaussian with the following mean ( $ \hat{f_{t}} $ ) and variance ( $ \mathbf{V}[f_{t}] $ ):
$$ \hat{f_{t}} = {\vec{k}_{t}}^{T} (K + \sigma_{n}^2I)^{-1} \vec{y} $$

$$ \mathbf{V}[f_{t}] = \kappa (\vec{x}_{t}, \vec{x}_{t}) - {\vec{k}_{t}}^{T} (K + \sigma_{n}^2I)^{-1} \vec{k}_{t} $$
where,  </p>

<ul>
<li> $K$ is a $n \times n$ matrix where the $ij$th entry is computed as $K_{ij} = \kappa (\vec{x}_i, \vec{x}_j)$,
<li>$\vec{y}$ is a $n \times 1$ vector formed by stacking the $n$ target values together from the dataset,</li>
<li>$I$ is a $n \times n$ identity matrix,</li>
<li>$\sigma^2$ is the noise variance,</li>
<li>$ \vec{k}_{t}$ is a $n \times 1$ vector where each entry is computed as $ \vec{k}_{t_{i}} = \kappa (\vec{x}_i, \vec{x}_{t})$</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to learn the different parameters (lengthscale(s) of the covariance kernel, the noise and signal variances), a common technique is to use the marginal likelihood maximization framework (this step can be thought of as the 'training' phase). The log marginal likelihood has the following form:</p>

<p>$$ LML = \log p(\vec{y} | X) = -\frac{1}{2} \vec{y}^T (K + \sigma_{n}^2I)^{-1}\vec{y} - \frac{1}{2} \log |K + \sigma_{n}^2I | - \frac{n}{2} \log 2\pi    $$  </p>

<p>If we consider $\vec{\theta}$ as the vector of parameters to estimate, gradient based methods (conjugate gradient of L-BFGS) can be employed after obtaining suitable analytic gradients $ \frac{\partial LML}{ \partial \vec{\theta}_i}$.</p>

<p>The main bottleneck for both training and prediction phases is the matrix inversion step which requires $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ flops, thus limiting the application of GPs for large datasets having $ n &gt; 10000$ samples.</p>

<p>Our main task in this project is to exploit the data parallelism available while constructing the $K$ matrix, as well as efficiently computing the matrix inverse. If time permits we would like to look at recent approximate approaches that might be more suitable for distributed GPU setting. [DN15, WN15]</p>

<h3>
<a id="challenges" class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Understand Gaussian Processes and then design an efficient implementation for performing parallel Regression on the same.</li>
<li>Gaussian Processes rely heavily on matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication matrix inversion. Thus, our main challenge will be to ensure that these bandwidth-bound operations are done efficiently on a GPU.</li>
<li>We hope to leverage currently available matrix operation routines provided by Magma [reference]. However, the Magma routines are built for general purpose matrix operations, and may have to sacrifice on application-specific optimizations. Therefore, another challenge for us is to try and exploit data access patterns and data locality to squeeze out performance while using general-purpose libraries.</li>
<li>We understand that achieving linear speedup as the number of cores on the GPU increases may be difficult to achieve due to the inherent nature of the algorithm to update some global state during each phase of the training phase. Therefore, much of our focus will be on achieving maximum acceleration on each individual iteration of the training phase.</li>
<li>Another challenge will be to ensure that the system scales as the size of the input and the processing power increase.
Now-a-days, the main focus is not on raw speedup obtained, but speedup obtained per dollar spent. Therefore, another challenge will be to explore whether it is truly better to implement Gaussian Processes on a GPU, or are we better off on a CPU.</li>
<li>The limitations of resources such as shared memory will limit the scaling that we may able to achieve as the problem size grows. However, given the resources that we have, we should be able to achieve good speedups for workloads upto a certain point beyond which the resources will make it tough to keep going at the same level of performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="plan-to-achieve" class="anchor" href="#plan-to-achieve" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plan to achieve</h3>

<ul>
<li>Implement a correct, parallel, and efficient implementation of Gaussian Processes on a wide variety of data sets.</li>
<li>Implement at least 3 covariance kernels.</li>
<li>Implement code to report metrics of the system. For instance, total job time, statistics about the utilization of compute resources (including divergence statistics), memory bandwidth achieved, accuracy obtained, etc. We will also compare the performance achieved by using different kernels which can potentially help the user to tune the choice of using kernels. For instance, the Squared Exponential Kernel may work well on a certain type of workload, or the Rational Quadratic Kernel may work well on certain other types of workloads etc.</li>
<li>Compare the system to an efficient serial version that runs on a CPU. Also, we understand that just calculating speedups when code is run on CPU vs GPU is not the correct way of judging how well a system has been designed. Therefore, as discussed previously, we will do a “throughput per dollar” comparison for both platforms and draw conclusions from the same.</li>
<li>Design and implement several test suites. These will be used to measure the performance of the code and to compare it to the baseline models.</li>
</ul>


<h3>
<a id="presentation" class="anchor" href="#presentation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Presentation</h3>
